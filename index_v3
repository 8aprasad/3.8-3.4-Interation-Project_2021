				<p><b>Educate & engage</b><br><br>
Every year thousands of abused, neglected and injured animals arrive in SPCAâ€™s care. To stop this trend we developed a free education programme that aims to improve animal lives by nurturing the young hearts and minds of Aotearoa, New Zealand. <a href="https://www.spca.nz/what-we-do/educate-and-engage/">https://www.spca.nz/what-we-do/educate-and-engage</a>

Our SPCA Inspectors, Field Officers and rescue teams work on the front line every day, rescuing animals who have been in an accident, abused, neglected, abandoned or caught up in natural disaster.
</p><p><b>Rehabilitate</b><br><br>
Our SPCA Centres, animal hospitals and co-operating vet clinics are the first stop for all animals that come into SPCA care. Here we provide essential care and medical treatment to animals that are sick and injured, as well as routine health checks, vaccinations, microchips and desexing.
<img src="images/copper.jpeg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%;margin-top:10%;border:2px solid black;margin-bottom:10%;"><b>Seek justice</b><br><br>
SPCA is the only charity with the legal powers to help animals in need and bring animal offenders to justice. Our Inspectors are appointed under the Animal Welfare Act 1999 which provides powers to investigate cruelty, abuse, neglect and abandonment.
